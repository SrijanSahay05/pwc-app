## User Registration Flow

1. **Start Registration**: User enters Email, Phone, First Name, Last Name (saved as RegistrationSession Model)
2. **OTP Verification**: Verifies Email and Phone using OTP services
3. **Set Password**: User sets their account password
4. **Account Creation**: CustomUser Model is created and RegistrationSession Model is deleted
5. **Profile Setup**: UserApplication and EducationDetails models are automatically created
